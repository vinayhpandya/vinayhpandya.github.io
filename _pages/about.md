I am a passionate Software Engineer with a strong focus on building efficient solutions that improve productivity and user experience. 

With a background in full-stack development, I am proficient in a wide array of programming languages and frameworks, including Java, Python, and C++. 

My work in both software engineering and machine learning has led to significant improvements in automation processes, including boosting efficiency by 20% in some cases.

My current interests are machine learning especially LLMs including multimodal models, RAG and vision models.

## Technical Skills

# Selected Experience

## ü§ñ Current open source contributions
- I currently contribute to [mlx-graphs](https://github.com/mlx-graphs/mlx-graphs) where I add homogeneous and hetreogeneous datasets as well as contribute to new graph algorithms.

- I also wrote a port of node2vec in mlx-graphs to effeciently scale and compute node features for a homogeneous graph.

- I also created and maintain [mlx-cluster](https://pypi.org/project/mlx-cluster/) which contains kernel code for node2vec to boost effeciency of generating random walks. I will be adding more algorithms as I go.
