## Mlx-cluster (Open Source)

A Python library for generating and calculating random graphs efficiently on Apple GPU using mlx-graphs and mlx.

- Utilized Metal kernels with Python for efficiently calculating random walks and biased random walks, achieving **1.2x performance** compared to regular PyTorch kernels on macOS
- Used Nanobind, Poetry, and Python Packaging Index (PyPI) for publishing the package

*Technologies: Python, MLX, Metal, Nanobind, Poetry*
